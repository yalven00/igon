<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

<p>This Agreement was last revised on March 3, 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to <a href="http://igobono.com">igobono.com</a>, a website and online service owned and operated by igobono, Inc. ("Igobono" "we," or "us").  This page explains the terms by which you may use our service. By accessing or using the Igobono services, website, applications and software provided through or in connection with the service, including through a mobile device ("Service"), you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement"), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service.</strong></p>

<p>The terms governing our Agreement with companies or individuals that have contracted for one or more of our paid services (a "Paid Network") are set forth <a href="">here</a> or in a separate agreement (collectively, "Business Terms"), but all users of the Service (whether of the free service or a paid service) must agree to these terms as well.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to amend this Agreement at any time and without notice. If we do this, we will post the amended Agreement on this page and indicate at the top of the page the date the Agreement was last revised.</p>

<p>Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</p>

<h3>Language of this Agreement</h3>

<p>The language of this Agreement shall be English.  Igobono may offer this Agreement in other languages in the future, but the English version shall always be controlling.  </p>

<h3>Use of Our Service</h3>

<p>Igobono provides a place for people to communicate and trade with others in their work, school or community networks (each, a "Network") in real time.</p>

<p>Igobono grants you permission to use the Service as set forth in this Agreement, provided that: (i) you will not copy, distribute, or disclose any part of the Service in any medium; (ii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Service other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Service for its intended purpose; and (iii) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>You will need to register with Igobono and create a “Member” account. Your account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion.</p>

<p>You may never use another Member’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify Igobono immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Igobono will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you shall be liable for the losses of Igobono or others due to such unauthorized use.</p>

<p>You may use your Account Settings to control your Member Profile. By providing Igobono with your email address, you consent to our using such email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You may use your Notifications Settings to opt out of many Service-related communications. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by changing the preferences in your Notifications Settings. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. Certain Paid Networks have negotiated further modifications to the emails we may send you.</p>

<p>Igobono may permanently or temporarily terminate, suspend, or otherwise refuse to permit your access to the Service without notice and liability, if, in Igobono's sole determination, you violate any terms of this Agreement, including the following prohibited actions: (i) attempting to interfere with, or otherwise compromise the system’s integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (ii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (iii) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (iv) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (v) interfering with the proper working of the Service; or, (vi) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including, but not limited to, registering for the Service with a non-Network email address. Upon termination for any reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

<p>You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Igobono servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation purposes. You agree not to use any portion of the Service as a destination linked from any unsolicited bulk messages or unsolicited commercial messages.</p>

<p>If you learn that a User is not authorized to be a Member of a Network or is otherwise violating this Agreement, we encourage you to visit such User's Member profile page and follow the "click here" link under the Admin section to notify us. You agree you will not accuse any User of being unauthorized or of violating this Agreement unless you have actual knowledge.
Igobono reserves the right to offer alternative and/or additional Services to certain administrative users, including administrators of Paid Networks, that may not be offered to general Users. You acknowledge that Igobono may charge a fee for the use of any Services, provided that Igobono notifies you of any such fee before you incur it. Subject to the foregoing, you agree to pay any fees incurred by you.</p>

<h3>User Content</h3>

<p>Some areas of the Service may allow Users to post feedback, comments, questions, data, and other information (“User Content”). You are solely responsible for your User Content that you upload, publish, display, link to or otherwise make available (hereinafter, “post”) on the Service, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of yoIgobonour User Content. Igobono will not review, share, distribute, or reference any such User Content except as provided herein or in our Privacy Policy or as may be required by law. Absent a Network Administrator (as defined below), all such User Content is owned by the User who posted it to the Service, although each User acknowledges and consents that upon the introduction of a Network Administrator into that User’s network, all related User Content will automatically become the property of the company to which the Network belongs without any notice to Users of that Network. If a Network has a Network Administrator, all such User Content is the property of the company to which the Network belongs (including all User Content posted to a specific Group or Groups within a Network and all User Content created prior to the existence of the Network Administrator). In either case, Igobono does not have, nor does it claim, any ownership rights in any User Content. In addition, you should note that if you are no longer an eligible member of a network (e.g., you cease to be employed by the relevant company), your access to all User Content you uploaded may be terminated, regardless of whether the network has a Network Administrator. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the company which administers that Network.</p>

<p>You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (iv) contains any information or content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, or otherwise objectionable; (v) contains any information or content that is illegal; (vi) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (vii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below), rights of publicity and privacy. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.</p>

<p>Igobono takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Content that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Service, is solely your responsibility. Igobono is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree that Igobono shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of such User Content.</p> 

<p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Igobono Users. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users.</p>

<h3>Network Administration</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li><h4>General</h4>
        <p>Each Network may have one or more individuals who are responsible for overseeing the use of, and monitoring the content posted to, such Network (the “Network Administrator”). Networks may exist on the Service absent a Network Administrator; in such case Users are responsible for conducting themselves in accordance with this Agreement.</p>

<p>If applicable, Users should follow their group’s policies, guidelines, and procedures concerning the Content they post to the Service. Users may delete their own User Content from the Network, so long as they are a Member of that Network. Network Administrators may delete the User Content of one or more Users in their Network.</p>

<p>From time to time, Users may be asked to confirm their account on the Network via an email message containing a hyperlink to the User’s Network email address. If such account is not reconfirmed, the account is removed. Once a User is removed from a Network, the content of that User remains on the Network and is the sole property of the group or organization which administers that Network.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Groups</h4>
        <p>Individual Users may form a group to segment the audience for certain User Content (“Group”). Each Group may have one or more administrators (the “Group Administrator”). A Group may be designated as open to any User in a Network (a “Public Group”) or a Group may be limited to certain Users in a Network with membership subject to the approval of the Group Administrator (a “Private Group”). A Group Administrator may add or remove Users to that particular Group. Though Users may establish a Private Group, User Content posted within a Private Group on a Network is owned by that Network.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mobile Use</h3>
	<ul>
    	<li><h4>General</h4>
		<p>Users may elect to receive regular short message service (“SMS”) alerts of new Igobono content through mobile telephone device carriers that may be supported via Igobono SMS. You may receive help for SMS content delivery via SMS by text messaging “HELP” to Igobono at xxxxx, or by contacting Igobono customer support at <a href="mailto:help@Igobono.com">help@Igobono.com</a>. There is no fee charged by Igobono for Users to receive text messages. Standard text messaging rates and other charges from a User’s carrier may apply.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Opt-in/Opt-out</h4>
        <p>To opt-in to SMS updates, you will sign up on the web at Igobono.com, register your mobile device, and receive a PIN number to your registered mobile device. After receipt of the PIN, you will then enter the PIN on the Igobono website to receive SMS alerts. When you register to receive the mobile alerts, you warrant that you are the legal own of the mobile device which you registered to receive mobile alerts messages and that you are authorized to incur any charges that may result from receiving mobile alert messages.</p>

<p>You may discontinue receipt of mobile alert messages by text messaging “STOP” or “QUIT” to Igobono short code xxxxx. You may also opt-out of SMS alerts at the Igobono website by changing your preferences in your Mobile Settings.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Text Message Content and Delivery</h4>
        <p>Igobono forwards the information that you have requested in the form of text messages from our partners. Igobono is not responsible for the contents of any information that is sent to your mobile device, since it is not the originator of this content. Igobono can make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or reliability of the contents and accuracy of that information.</p>

<p>Igobono does not warrant that the text messaging service will be uninterrupted or error free. We shall not be liable for any delay in performing or failure to perform any obligation hereunder by circumstances beyond our reasonable control including (without limitation) any technical problems beyond the control of Igobono such as (for example) defects, congestion or failures of capacity or otherwise in the public data or telephone or mobile carrier network or caused by atmospheric interference, your mobile device being turned off for an extended period of time so that messages are not retained, or your being unable to obtain mobile network coverage.</p></li>
       </ul>

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
<li>Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Igobono, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Igobono that arises in whole or in part from the Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California.</li>

<li>Notification Procedures. Igobono may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Igobono in our sole discretion.

<li>Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any other legal notices and agreements published by Igobono via the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Igobono concerning the Service (although the owner of the Network may also have agreed to be bound by the Business Terms).

<li> No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Igobono's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
